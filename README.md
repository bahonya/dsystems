# Network programming lab

The goal of this lab assignment is to get you started with network programming
in python.

This lab assignment consist of three parts. In `udp-echo/` you are expected
to implement a simple UDP echo server that is able to respond to different
commands specified as text.  
In `tcp-echo/` you will replace the UDP communication in the echo server
with TCP.  
In `rpc-kv/` you will implement a key-value storage using RPC.
